This is the exact code which was used to perform simulations for (Naumova 2013) ("Organization of the Mitotic Chromosome") publication. Note that the files in the "originalFiles" folder were simply copied from their original context; those files may refer to other files present in our system, and filenames for these files will need to be updated and proper input files will need to be created. 

The file used to create Consecutive loops model ("scaffoldExample.py") was updated to be run standalone, and only needs an input conformation. However, other files were not modified 

To run this code on your computer, you would need to do the following things. 
1. Install OpenMM and openmm-polymer (https://simtk.org/project/xml/downloads.xml?group_id=161, version 5.2 for OpenMM; http://bitbucket.org/mirnylab/openmm-polymer for openmm-polymer), follow instructions on OpenMM website and mimakaev.bitbucket.org. 
2. Create meaningful initial conformations as described in the supplemental methods.
3. Change the part of the code which loads initial conformations. 
4. Fix errors which may from possible incompabibility with the new openmm versions, or downgrade to the old revision mentioned in the manuscript. Usually, an error message will tell you what exactly needs to be updated.

Please note that scaffold.py code was used interactively. First, the first stage fiber was created. Then the code was modified to load the file with the first fiber, and to include the second stage fiber. Please refer to the supplemental materials for timings and details of the parameters; not all forces which are in the file were used for actual simulations.
